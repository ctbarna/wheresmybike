# Where's my bike(share)?

There are only two things that I ever want from bikeshare apps:

 * Finding the closest station with a bike.
 * Finding the closest station to my destination.

To date, I have not found anything that only does these things. Where's
my bike(share) attempts to make a simple interface that solves these
problems.
